# Map

Consider that a list of some form
```js
const values = [
    {
        id: 1,
        value = 1
    },
    ...
    {
        id: 100,
        value =100
    }
]
```

We can use the map function to render the element in that array
```js
{values.map(val => 
    <div key={val.id}>
        {val.value}
    </div>
)}
```
notice the inclusion of the key attribute. Each element generated by the map method must have a unique key. It is not recommended to have the array index as the key.
